# London Underground Journey Planner ðŸš‡

## Overview
This project is part of the **COMP1828 Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures** coursework at the **University of Greenwich**. It focuses on developing an efficient **journey planner** for the **London Underground** network using advanced **graph algorithms**.

## Features âœ…
- **Shortest Path Calculation** â€“ Computes optimal routes between stations.
- **Time & Stop-Based Routes** â€“ Finds paths based on journey time (minutes) or number of stops.
- **Graph Algorithms** â€“ Implements **Dijkstra's algorithm** and **BFS** for route optimization.
- **Data Processing** â€“ Uses real-world London Underground data.
- **Algorithm Complexity Analysis** â€“ Compares empirical execution time with theoretical complexity.
- **Histogram Visualization** â€“ Displays journey duration distributions.
- **Network Disruption Simulation** â€“ Analyzes the impact of closing certain routes.
